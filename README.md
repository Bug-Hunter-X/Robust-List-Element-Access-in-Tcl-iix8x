This repository contains a Tcl script demonstrating a common, yet subtle, error related to list indexing and its solution. The `bug.tcl` file showcases the problem of accessing list elements with out-of-bounds indices using the built-in `lindex` command.  The `bugSolution.tcl` file provides an improved function that explicitly checks for index validity and returns an error message for out-of-bounds indices. This ensures more robust error handling and avoids silent failures.
